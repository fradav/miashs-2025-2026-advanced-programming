# Prerequisites

## Software required

You will need to install the following software on your computer:
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode), a free and open-source code editor. You’ll have to install the following extensions:

- ![](images/python-ext.png){ width=60 } [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) to have everything you need to work with Python.
- ![](images/liveshare-ext.png){ width=60 } [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) to enable collaborative editing.
- ![](images/continue-ext.svg){ width=60 } [Continue.dev](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) to have the AI Code Assistant we will use as example in this course.

## AI Assistant, getting API Key.

For the practical work, you’ll need to get API Keys from [Mistral.ai’s "La Plateforme"](https://console.mistral.ai/home) (it’s completely free). You will need a valid cell phone number for the registration to work. Contact me if this is a problem.

![Mistral Login](../images/mistral-login.png)

The first time, you’ll have to create an account. Then, you’ll be able to get your API Key.

Once there, Click on "API Keys" tab.

Click on "Choose a plan".

![No plan](images/mistral-no-plan.png)

Choose "Experiment" plan.

Accept the conditions.

Give a phone number for the final check.

![Phone number check](images/mistral-register-phone.png)

Confirm the code.

If successful, return on the "AI Keys" Tab and choose "Create a new key"

Choose a name and an expiration date for your key (could be never if not set).

Copy the key and save it somewhere.

::: {.callout-tip}
You may also create a specific key for Codestral model, which could be used for auto-completion role. Auto-completion role needs specifically tailored models for this task, and the models you can access with the "generic" mistral key aren’t.

## VSCode setup

When you installed your continue vscode extension, it created a `.continue` folder in your home directory, which is `~/.continue` on Linux and Mac, and `%USERPROFILE%\.continue` on Windows. Create a `.env` file there and put your mistral key in it, like this:

```
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Optionally if you got a codestral key put it too:

```
CODESTRAL_API_KEY=your_codestral_key_here
```

Open/Create `config.yaml` file in the same folder and put this in it:

```yaml
name: miashs/mistral
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1
models:

Congratulations, you are now set for use of `continue` AI Code Assistant. You can open the chat panel either by clicking on the `Continue` in the right bottom status of vscode window or with Cmd + L (Mac) or Ctrl + L (Windows/Linux).


## Collaborative editing

- In the discord channel, I’ll provide you a link to join a collaborative editing session. Don’t click on it, just copy it: ![](images/liveshare-link.png)
- Then open a new “blank” window in VSCode, which will be exclusively for collaborative session. ![](images/blank-vsode.png)
- Then, click on the “Live Share” button in the bottom left corner of the window ![](images/liveshare-button.png)
- Click on the “Join” button ![](images/liveshare-join.png)
- Either choose anonymous or sign in with your github/microsoft account ![](images/anon-or-signin.png)

:::{.callout-note title="Anonymous Guest Name"}
If you choose to sign in, you’ll have to authorize VSCode to access your github/microsoft account. If you choose anonymous, you’ll have to choose a username. Please choose a username that is easily identifiable as yours.
